                <p><strong>Detailed Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p>Blockchain works in the following steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Transaction Creation:</strong> A transaction is initiated by a user.</li>
                    <li><strong>Block Creation:</strong> Transactions are grouped into a block.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consensus Mechanism:</strong> The block is validated by network participants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Block Addition:</strong> Once validated, the block is added to the blockchain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Update Ledger:</strong> All nodes update their ledger with the new block.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="mermaid">
                    graph TD;
                    A[Transaction Creation] --> B[Block Creation];
